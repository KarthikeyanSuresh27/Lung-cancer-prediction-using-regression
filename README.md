# Lung-cancer-prediction-using-regression
Goal is to examine whether low income groups are at greater risk for being diagnosed and dying from cancer.

We will be using open data. Fortunately, the US federal government has published open data fitting our present needs -- for example, cancer.gov for cancer incidence and mortality data, and the Census American Community Survey for a multitude of additional variables we may choose to include in our model.

Objectives:

Gather, Clean and prepare data
Exploratory analysis
Statistical model
Visualizations
